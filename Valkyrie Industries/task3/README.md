> Write an Arduino IDE code for BLE communication code between two ESP32 modules (DevKit WROOM modules) that would be (if you donâ€™t have ESP modules, Traditional Bluetooth for Arduino would work too)
> 1. Continuous with max 10ms between connection events; 
> 2. Real-time (max 10ms delay); 
> 3. Bi-directional (sends and receives); 
> 4. Each connection event should have 150-byte payload; 
> 5. Implement error-check.
